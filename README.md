## About The Project

This project proposes creating an SPA (Single Page Application) as a reference for React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

The use for this project will depend on the use case:

- Customizing the integration project with builders like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- For creating pipelining in a DevOps cycle, either deployment, test validation, etc.
- To improve the inside code, no matter the library or frameworks around the Frontend API implementation (REST, GraphQL,
  gRPC).

### Collaboration

The project supports the feature-branch division for each technology (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).

Both WriterSide and GitHub Wiki will follow the documentation. The reason to use both is to have a better experience to
add content and consult it.
